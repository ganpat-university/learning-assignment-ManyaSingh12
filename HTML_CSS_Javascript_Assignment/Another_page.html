<h1>India Winning U19 World Cup</h1>
<p>It was India's seamers, not spinners, who plotted England's downfall in the Under-19 World Cup final as Raj Bawa and Ravi Kumar produced match-winning bowling performances to share nine wickets and dismiss their opponents for 189.
 Bawa's 5 for 31 was the best bowling performance in an U-19 World Cup final, while Ravi finished with 4 for 34</p>

<p>Even though India won by only four wickets, they were always ahead in the chase. Shaik Rasheed hit a fifty, Nishant Sindhu finished unbeaten on 50, too, and Bawa made a crucial 35. 
And as it is often the case with Indians at World Cup finals, it was a wicketkeeper who hit a six to seal the title.</p>

<p>Although England struck with wickets that prevented India from posting big partnerships, the modest target of 190 put very little pressure on them. That England even reached 189
 was courtesy James Rew's valiant 95, which rescued them from 91 for 7 after Tom Prest chose to bat at the toss.</p>

<p>Rew and William Luxton were left with the task of starting England's recovery, but they could last only 16 balls together as Bawa struck twice in consecutive deliveries. He found extra bounce with a wide-ish ball, and Luxton went chasing only to edge it to the wicketkeeper Dinesh Bana. George Bell was gone for a duck when Bawa welcomed him with a short ball, and all he could do was glove it to Bana trying to block off the back foot. From 45 for 5,
 England were soon 91 for 7 following the wickets of Rehan Ahmed, caught at slip off Bawa, and Alex Horton, who dragged offspinner Kaushal Tambe to midwicket.</p>
